## About the Weather App
Weather App is a web application built using Laravel v10.21.0 (PHP framework) and Vue.js v3.2.36 (JavaScript framework) that allows users to check the current weather forecast for Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, and Nagoya. It also provides suggested accomodations/hotels and tourist spots. Specifically, it aims to provide travel information of Japan for foreign tourists visiting Japan for the first time.

This UI/UX code implementation is the best as it effectively utilizes the reusability of API components. Each of the six cities in Japan utilizes only one component for the Weather, Places (Accommodations), and Tourism (Tourist Spots) APIs, demonstrating the full potential of Vue.js. 

At the home page, we can easily see the weather information, accomodations, and suggested tourist spots with the addresses at a glance. This makes it easy for foreign tourists to get an idea of where they want to go.
